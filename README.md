<h1>Carnage</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Eric Fischer from the Purchasing Department at Bartell Ltd has received an email from a known contact with a Word document attachment.  Upon opening the document, he accidentally clicked on "Enable Content."  The SOC Department immediately received an alert from the endpoint agent that Eric's workstation was making suspicious connections outbound. The pcap was retrieved from the network sensor and handed to you for analysis. 

Task: Investigate the packet capture and uncover the malicious activities. 

NOTE: DO NOT directly interact with any domains and IP addresses in this challenge.

To get the complete total number of events, we must first set the time filter to "All Time"(enclosed in pink on the top right). Then I input "index=main" on the search bar. The answer is enclosed in the red box. <br/>

The question states the adversaty CREATING a backdoor user. I googled the event id associated with user creation and recieved event id 4720. I then added EventID=4720 into the search bar. I scrolled down and found the newly created user. At a quick glance it might read Alberto but the "l" is actually a "1" thus giving the answer.    <br/>

To find the answer I did a few things. Frist, I google for the event id that was associated with registry modification. The event id I received and inputted resulted in zero events. I removed the attempted event id search and instead, I then added the user "A1berto" into the search bar since the user "A1berto" is still the topic. It helped to reduced the number of events low enough where I wouldn't mind scrolling and reading through the events to find the answer. However, I want to be a bit more precise. I looked through the fields and found "extracted_EventType" which caught my eye. I clicked it and saw CreateKey so I added that into my search resulting in 1 event.

<b>Answer the question below <br/>

What is the name of the webserver of the malicious IP from which the zip file was downloaded?

<p align="center">
I knew to look for an executable file(.exe). Since the question asked what command was used, I looked the a field containing the word command and "CommandLine" appeared. I did a quick look at it and saw one that looked suspicious. I decided to seach the field "CommandLine" as a wildcard just to not overlook anything. Also, I once again added user "A1berto" to focus the search. <br/>
<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c295758a-0cf0-42ab-be0c-7f12cb61cc74" />

  
With 7 results I looked through them all. Looking at each CommandLine field within the events, the one that had looked suspicious to me was the answer to the question.

After looking at how others solved this question, there is a more efficient way. There is an event id associated with program execution (Event ID 4688)
<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b2a15b3-7489-4844-831e-0e2871c29a48" />
The full search should be " index=main EventID=4688 A1berto ". Look at the CommandLine field and you'll find the same answer. Through this search I learned that WMIC is a software utility that allows users to perform Windows Management Instrumentation operations with a command prompt. That ransomware authors have been seen to use wmic.exe to gain access to remote systems and then perform processes on it to prepare for or execute the ransomware attack.
